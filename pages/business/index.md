# 🧩 Business Guidelines

## Overview

The business system is here to create roleplay and keep the city active. Businesses should give players somewhere to go, something to do, and reasons to interact with each other. Making money is part of it, but it shouldn’t be the only goal.
Owning a business isn’t permanent. Staff may review businesses if they become inactive, cause ongoing problems, or stop contributing to the server.

## Ownership and Activity

Each business should have one main owner (possibly a Co-Owner) who is responsible for how the business runs. This includes staff behavior, activity levels, and making sure rules are being followed.
Businesses are expected to open and operate somewhat regularly. Nobody expects daily openings, but if a business disappears for long periods without notice it may be reviewed so the spot isn’t locked up. Staff will usually try to contact the owner before making any decisions where possible.

If you own a business, you are responsible for ensuring it is fully functional within the city. If required assets such as a suitable MLO (interior) or job-specific clothing/uniforms are not already available in the server, the owner is obligated to provide them.

## Roleplay Expectations

Businesses should create roleplay, not avoid it. Players should feel like they can walk in, interact, and get something out of the experience.
Running a business purely for income, avoiding interaction, or doing the bare minimum may lead to a review if it becomes a consistent issue.

## Owners and Employees

Owners are responsible for their employees while they are working under the business name. Internal issues should be handled by management first before involving staff unless server rules are being broken.
Employees must follow server rules while on duty and should only represent businesses they are actually employed by. Abuse of access, equipment, or position will be treated seriously.
Owners are also responsible for ensuring their business has appropriate uniforms, branding, and a proper working environment that fits the roleplay standard of the server.

## Economy and Competition

Pricing should stay reasonable and in line with the server economy. Trying to manipulate pricing, create artificial shortages, or damage the economy will result in staff stepping in.
Competition between businesses is fine and encouraged, but it needs to stay in roleplay. OOC targeting or attempts to shut down other businesses outside of RP isn’t acceptable.

## Events and Advertising

Businesses are encouraged to advertise and run events. Events should be organized responsibly and not intentionally disrupt other businesses or server performance.
Large events may need staff awareness depending on size.

## Restrictions

The following is not allowed:
- Using business ownership to get around server rules
- Holding a business while inactive and preventing others from using it
- Using business resources for personal gain outside of roleplay
- Creating conflict outside of roleplay situations

## Staff intervention

Staff may step in if a business becomes inactive, repeatedly causes problems, negatively affects the economy, or receives consistent verified complaints.
This can result in warnings, changes to how the business operates, temporary closure, or ownership removal depending on the situation.

## Business Closure

Businesses may be closed if the owner steps down, becomes inactive, or the business no longer contributes to roleplay. Closed businesses may later reopen under new ownership if appropriate.

## Final Note

The business system works best when owners stay active, fair, and focused on creating roleplay for others. The goal is to keep the city feeling alive rather than limiting opportunities.
