# 📘 Rules Overview

Welcome to Pinnacle Roleplay. These rules exist to protect the quality of roleplay, keep interactions fair, and maintain a safe, serious environment.

## 📣 Reporting Rule Breaks

For in-game rule breaks against a player, please use `/report` in city or open a ticket in Discord. Be specific and descriptive in your reports. Vague requests like "admin to me" or "my car is broken" will not receive a response.

Failure to use these channels, including directly messaging staff or interrupting roleplay to handle your issue, is considered a breach and may result in disciplinary action.

## 🎂 Age Restrictions

Every roleplayed character within Pinnacle Roleplay must be 18+.

This includes:

- Voice: childlike tones or speech patterns
- Sayings: language or references that indicate a minor
- Appearance: outfits or animations meant to depict a minor

## 🏆 Roleplay Quality Awards

Quality roleplay is noticed and rewarded. Each month, staff may award:

- Roleplayer of the Month
- Roleplaying Gang of the Month
- Police Roleplayer of the Month
- Business Roleplayer of the Month
- Paramedic Roleplayer of the Month

## ✅ General Roleplay Expectations

- When revived by EMS, roleplay your injuries with paramedics.
- When pulled over, react in a way that fits your character and situation.
- If you crash or cause a wreck, roleplay the aftermath instead of immediately driving away.
