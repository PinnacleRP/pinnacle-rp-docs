# 📘 Rules Overview

Welcome to Pinnacle Roleplay. Listed below will be all of the rules of the server. We want to ensure a fun, safe and serious Roleplay environment. Any breakage of the rules will result in disciplinary actions decided by the staff team.

## 📣 Reporting Rule Breaks

For in-game rule breaks against a player, please use `/report` in city or open a ticket in Discord. Be specific and descriptive in your reports. Vague requests like "admin to me" or "my car is broken" will not receive a response.

Failure to use these channels, including directly messaging staff or interrupting roleplay to handle your issue, is considered a breach and may result in disciplinary action.

## Premade Ped’s & Animals Peds’s

Using premade GTA PEDs (NPCs/Locals), including animals, without approval from the Administration team is prohibited.

If you wish to roleplay as an NPC/local PED, please send a direct message to our Discord support bot so your request can be assessed.

## 🎂 Age Restrictions

Every roleplayed character within Pinnacle Roleplay must be 18+.

This also extends to portraying anyone under the age of 18 through:

- **Voice:** childlike voices, tones or speech patterns.
- **Sayings:** Using language, references or behavior that would clearly indicate a charcter is a minor.
- **Appearance:** Designing a character's look, clothing or animations to resemble someone under the age of 18.

All reports of this will be dealt with by staff and up to their discretion.

## 🏆 Roleplay Quality Awards

People that bring good roleplay to the server will be noticed and will be awarded for such RP. We will announce the following winners once a month:

- Roleplayer of the Month
- Roleplaying Gang of the Month
- Police Roleplayer of the Month
- Business Roleplayer of the Month
- Paramedic Roleplayer of the Month

The winners for this will be determined by a few grading metrics that staff have set. These metrics will not be released for the public, but we can promise you everything will be scored a certain way and handed out to the best Quality roleplayer(s) of that Month. 

The winner for each category will receive 1 free Supporter car, except for Roleplaying Gang of the Month. Roleplaying Gang of the Month will receive a different prize that will be useful for their whole gang.

## ✅ General Roleplay Expectations

Here in PinnacleRP we take roleplay quality very seriously. Below will be a few things that we expect people to do and not take the ‘short’ route in Roleplay:

- When revived by EMS, you are expected to roleplay your injuries out with the paramedics at the very least.
- When pulled over by the police you must make a choice that makes sense in your Roleplay. Some examples, but not limited to:
    - If you have no warrants or any suspicion of getting arrested, you need to at least hear the cops reasoning for the traffic stop
    - If you have a warrant out that you are aware of, you can go on a chase, but we still would advise hearing the officers' reasoning for the stop because they could just be giving you a ticket for a traffic violation. Once they mention to step out of the vehicle you can pull off
    - If you just shot someone that you think the police saw, you can just go on a chase to get away

- If you get in a car accident, Roleplay it out. We aren’t saying you have to make a 20 minute scene each time, but pulling straight off and denying that roleplay from all parties involved is not allowed. At least ask if they’re okay and if they need you to call the ambulance
