# ☠️ Random Death Match (RDM)

Killing a player without legitimate RP intentions or interactions is prohibited. If you’ve had a hostile interaction with a player and your RP outcome is to kill them, you must declare properly. If the situation is complex, staff reserve the right to determine if the scenario is legit or just RDM.

## 'Must win attitude'

An attitude driven solely by the desire to win is unacceptable. Remember, this is roleplay, and it's natural to experience both victories and defeats.
