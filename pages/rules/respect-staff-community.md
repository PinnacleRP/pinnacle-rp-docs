# 🧑‍⚖️ Staff and Community Conduct

## Respect Toward Staff

Our community holds itself to high standards of respect and professionalism. Staff abuse, slander and disputes are not acceptable. If a staff member provides guidance or imposes a sanction, please refrain from arguing on the spot. If you believe a decision is unjust, we encourage you to submit a staff ticket via our Discord with all evidence. Escalating disagreements with staff only makes matters worse. If you ever have concerns regarding staff conduct, please report it via an Admin or Management ticket.

## 📣 Advertising

Members are not permitted to advertise or promote other FiveM servers, services, or communities on our platforms. This includes, but is not limited to, posting links, sharing direct messages with other members, or making indirect references (e.g., using phrases or innuendo to promote or reference other servers). Any form of promotion, no matter how subtle or indirect, is strictly prohibited.

Additionally, if you have a hoisted role in the Discord server and your activity status displays another server or group, your role may be removed.


## 💬 Discord Name Formats

You are not required to change your Discord username to match your character name in the Pinnacle Roleplay Discord server. However, if you participate in a Discord server specifically for roleplay interactions and announcements (such as EMS or Business Discords), you must set your Discord nickname to your character name.

## 🧯 Trolling and Disruptive Behavior

We expect all players to join with the genuine intention to engage in immersive, serious and meaningful roleplay. The following behaviours are strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action, including possible removal from the server:

- **Trolling:** Any behaviour intended to provoke, annoy, or interfere with others. This includes but is not limited to:
    - Running up to people and making silly or outrageous comments to start fights
    - Purposefully trying to ruin serious roleplay scenes
    - Using emotes, animations, or props to annoy or disrupt others
    - Playing music or loud noises through your microphone
    - Following or harassing other players without RP justification
    - Spamming interactions or actions repeatedly to irritate others

- **Lack of Roleplay Intent:** Joining the server with no real aim to roleplay. This includes but is not limited to:
    - Constantly trying to provoke others into combat
    - Ignoring attempts at roleplay or responding with OOC-style behaviour while in character

- **Disruptive Behaviour:** Anything that ruins the roleplay experience for others. This includes but is not limited to:
    - Interrupting or crashing RP scenes you're not involved in
    - Repeatedly yelling or speaking over others in voice chat
    - Exploiting animations or mechanics to be annoying or unrealistic
