# 🧑‍⚖️ Staff and Community Conduct

## Respect Toward Staff

Staff abuse, slander, and disputes are not acceptable. If a staff member provides guidance or imposes a sanction, do not argue in the moment. If you believe a decision is unfair, open a staff ticket in Discord with evidence.

If you have concerns about staff conduct, report it through an Admin or Management ticket.

## 📣 Advertising

Members may not advertise or promote other FiveM servers, services, or communities in any form. This includes links, direct messages, or indirect references. If you have a hoisted role in Discord and your activity status shows another server or group, your role may be removed.

## 💬 Discord Name Formats

You do not have to change your Discord username to match your character name in the Pinnacle Roleplay Discord. However, if you participate in a roleplay-specific Discord (EMS, Business, etc.), your nickname must match your character name.

## 🧯 Trolling and Disruptive Behavior

We expect all players to join with genuine roleplay intent. Trolling, lack of RP intent, or disruptive behavior is not allowed, including:

- Harassing or following players without RP justification
- Intentionally ruining serious scenes
- Spamming emotes, props, or loud audio
- Yelling or speaking over others repeatedly
