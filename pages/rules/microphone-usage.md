# 🎙️ Microphone Requirements

All players must use a functional and clear microphone to participate. Your microphone must not produce excessive background noise, static, or echoing. Obscene or disruptive background sounds are strictly prohibited.

Playing without a microphone is not allowed. This includes using text chat in situations where voice communication is expected.

If you have a legitimate medical reason, disability, or condition that limits your ability to use voice communication, you must open a ticket and receive administrator approval for an exemption.
