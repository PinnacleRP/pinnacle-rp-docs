# 🎙️ Microphone Requirements

To ensure high-quality roleplay and seamless communication, all players must use a functional and clear microphone to participate. Your microphone must not produce excessive background noise, static, or inaudible echoing. Obscene or disruptive background sounds, such as yelling, music, or loud environmental noise, are strictly prohibited.

Playing without a microphone is not allowed. This includes using text chat or typing to communicate in situations where voice communication is expected. Proper verbal communication is essential to maintaining immersive roleplay.

If you have a **legitimate medical reason, disability, or condition** that prohibits or significantly impacts your ability to use voice communication, you **must open a ticket** and receive **administrator approval** to be exempt from the microphone requirement. Failure to obtain prior approval will be considered a breach of server rules.
