# 💪 Powergaming

Powergaming is forcing actions, outcomes or advantages without giving others fair opportunity to roleplay. This also includes things that your character wouldn’t be able to realistically (to an extent) in the real world.

**Powergaming includes, but is not limited to:**
- Forcing another players actions or reactions
- Performing unrealistic or impossible actions
- Acting on outcomes without giving others a chance to respond
- Using mechanics or wording to gain an unfair advantage

**Examples of Powering gaming:**
- Forcing a player to get medical attention to continue the scene (this excludes Police RP)
- /me actions that remove another players ability to react
- Declaring success without interaction (e.g. “I knock you out” without RP)
- Listening to voices through walls and using that information if you’re not in that conversation
- Using emotes or commands to bypass roleplay progression (Emote canceling and emote exploiting)
- Drugs or crafting exploits included but not limited to - growing/cooking indoors in areas that are a restricted access area. Examples:
    - MLO
    - Interiors
    - Exploiting the crafting bench distance
    - Setting macro's to AFK farm any activity or step
- Searching bushes by spam tackling
- Using job menus while off-duty
- Baiting or provoking players in a safe zone

Always roleplay with realism in mind. If you’re uncertain whether an action might be powergaming, assume that it is and refrain from doing it.
