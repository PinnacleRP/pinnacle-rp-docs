# 💪 Powergaming

Powergaming is forcing actions, outcomes, or advantages without giving others a fair opportunity to roleplay. It also includes unrealistic actions your character would not be able to do in real life.

## Examples of Powergaming

- Forcing another player's actions or reactions
- Performing unrealistic or impossible actions
- Declaring success without interaction ("I knock you out" without RP)
- Listening through walls and using that info
- Using emotes or commands to bypass roleplay progression
- Exploiting drugs or crafting mechanics (indoors, distance abuse, or macros)
- Searching bushes by spam tackling
- Using job menus while off-duty
- Baiting or provoking players in a safe zone
