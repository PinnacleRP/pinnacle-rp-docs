# 🧠 Metagaming

**Metagaming is strictly prohibited.**
Players must not use information or knowledge that their character would not reasonably have access to within the in-game world.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Information gained from Discord, live streams, external chats or voice calls
- Information gained while dead, downed or spectating
- Any form of OOC communication used to influence IC actions

## Voice Identification and Recognition

Recognising or identifying a character by their voice alone is considered metagaming, unless your character has a clear, prior in-character relationship or interaction history that reasonably justifies recognition

You may not identify, call out or act on a player’s identity solely based on:
    - Voice similarity 
    - Accent
    - Speech patterns
    - Familiarity from OOC interactions

## External Voice During RP

- Being in external voice chats during active roleplay situations is strongly discouraged to remove any possibility of metagaming.
- Using external voice or communication to coordinate, relay information or influence IC actions is considered metagaming

**Staff withhold the right to take disciplinary action on anyone participating in metagaming.**
