# 🧠 Metagaming

Metagaming is strictly prohibited. Players must not use information their character would not reasonably have access to within the game world.

This includes:

- Information gained from Discord, live streams, external chats, or voice calls
- Information gained while dead, downed, or spectating
- Any OOC communication used to influence IC actions

## Voice Identification and Recognition

Recognizing a character by voice alone is metagaming unless you have a prior in-character relationship that justifies it. You may not identify a player based solely on voice similarity, accent, or speech patterns.

## External Voice During RP

Using external voice or communication to coordinate, relay information, or influence IC actions during active roleplay is considered metagaming.
