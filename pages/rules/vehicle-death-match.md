# 🚗 Vehicle Death Match (VDM)

Using your vehicle to intentionally harm or kill another player is strictly forbidden. While vehicles should not be weaponized in roleplay scenarios, performing a "pit" manoeuvre below 200KPH speeds is permissible. However, when considering a pit manoeuvre, ensure that it adheres to the realistic driving guidelines, especially regarding speed.
