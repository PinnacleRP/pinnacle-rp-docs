# 🔥 Hostile Roleplay Rules

## Safe Zones

Designated areas and all officially recognized businesses are safe zones. Hostile roleplay, shooting, or ramming is not allowed within these areas. It is also forbidden to start a hostile interaction and then seek refuge in a safe zone or transport a player out of a safe zone to begin hostilities.

## Hostile Roleplay Restrictions

For balanced interactions in Pinnacle, adhere to the following guidelines regarding hostile/police numbers and engagement:

- **Hostile Number Limitation:** If you are not participating in conflict or hostile roleplay as part of a crew/gang/org than you must adhere to a limit of 8 participants.
- **Robberies & Heists:** You are allowed up to 8 participants (3 external max), but you are limited to only 1 vehicle for the intitial escape.
- **Emergency Service Worker Immunity:** Do not rob any items from emergency services personnel, which includes; Ambulance, Fire, and Police personnel.
- **Taking Police, Ambulance or Fire Personnel (EMS) Hostage:** You are only allowed to take Police hostage. Ambulance and Fire personnel are off limits. When taking police hostage, the roleplay must make sense and fit the current roleplay scene. Examples of this:
    - They are transporting a gang member/friend of yours
    - They seized your weapons and are currently transporting them (can not kidnap if weapons are already transported to MRPD)
    - You accept a bounty to kidnap an officer and bring them back to the person
When kidnapping officers, there must either be a standoff where you declare demands OR a call/text exchanging these demands. You can NOT kidnap an officer with the intent to just kill them.

## Fear RP / Valuing Your Life

Value your character's life as you would your own. While portraying bravery is commendable, it should not venture into the realm of the unrealistic. Here are some guidelines to ensure you're giving due regard to your character's life:

- **Real-world precautions apply:** Just as you'd check both directions before crossing a street in reality, your character should do the same in-game.
- **Guns dictate caution:** If someone draws a gun on you and you don’t have a weapon out, it's prudent to surrender. Similarly, if you're in a stationary vehicle and threatened with a firearm, you should heed the aggressor's commands. However, if your vehicle is already running, you may drive away, but deliberately running over the aggressor is not allowed and will be considered a breach of the VDM (Vehicle Deathmatch) rule
- **Avoid recklessness:** Stay clear of shootouts, don't crash your vehicle intentionally, and avoid actions like leaping from cliffs. Claiming to be a "daredevil" doesn't justify such behavior.
- **Exceptions:** Certain organisations, under specific scenarios, may have some leeway. For example, they might be allowed to escape to protect their assets. This is at the discretion of the staff.
- **Valuing life in confrontations:**
    - Do no bait or force interactions with Organisations or the Police
    - During robberies or when held at gunpoint, prioritise safety by being compliant. If asked to unlock your vehicle under such circumstances, you must oblige.

In essence, always approach situations with a balance of in-character bravery and genuine concern for your character's well-being.

## Robbing and Scamming

- **Robbing:** Robbing other players is permissible, **but only after meaningful interaction or engagement between the involved parties.** Meaningful Roleplay entrails creating a narrative with depth, context and character development. This includes, but is not limited to, building backstories and establishing motives. You are not allowed to find a random person or someone you dislike and just randomly decide to rob them. General hostilities with another group of individuals do not justify repeated robberies of those individuals.
- Robbing restrictions: You are **not** allowed to rob someone for whitelist job items
- **Robbing dead bodies:** This is **not** allowed
- **Scamming:** Scamming is **not** allowed

**Police and Ambulance personnel equipment is strictly off-limits for robbing**

Players primarily focused on robbing/scamming for personal or financial gain, or those who habitually commit robberies/scams, will face staff action under this rule. Final decisions rest with the Administration team. 

## Baiting

Intentionally provoking or antagonizing police or criminal organisations for the sole purpose of initiating an interaction, chase, or shootout without meaningful roleplay context is prohibited.

This includes actions such as:
    - Purposely driving recklessly around police or gang members to trigger a chase.
    - Verbally taunting or harassing individuals or groups with no roleplay justification.
    - Creating artificial scenarios that serve only to force conflict without story or character development.
    - Posing as a gang that you are not apart of - no gang baiting

Roleplay should develop organically and realistically — baiting for the sake of “something to do” is not acceptable.

## Combat Logging

Players are prohibited from disconnecting or forcefully exiting the game to avoid any roleplay scenario, including but not limited to combat, police chases, and other conflict situations. This rule applies at all times, regardless of the in-game status or real-life circumstances.

If you need to leave the game, ensure you are not in an active roleplay situation before doing so. After initiating or engaging in any hostile or illegal interactions (such as shootouts, robberies, or police pursuits), you must remain in the server for at least 10 minutes from the time you began the scenario. For example, if you evade police after committing a crime and manage to hide to lose them, you still cannot disconnect until the 10 minute period has elapsed.

## Hostile RP Guidelines

Hostile roleplay is a core part of criminal interaction within PinnableRP. These rules ensure engagements remain fair, meaningful and grounded in proper roleplay.

**General Hostile RP**
- Hostile RP cannot be initiated on players engaged in legal activities without meaningful interaction beforehand.
- Red Zones are KOS areas.
- Helmets are **NOT** allowed in any hostile situation. Only exception is LSPD.
- Boot-checking is not permitted unless meaningful RP occurred prior.
- Killing a player and then robbing them is not allowed. You can only do one or the other. Only exception is on Cayo island during KOS time.
- No hostility may be initiated 30 minutes before server restart.
- If a robbed player escalates to deadly force, lethal retaliation is permitted.
- Hostages must have no personal or gang affiliation with the captor. We expect everyone to capture a hostage legit with meaningful 2 minutes (atleast) of RP before taking them
- Hostages cannot be taken solely for financial gain

**Robberies & Theft**

Robberies may be initiated against players actively performing illegal activities, including:

- Drug dealing or processing
- Illegal crafting (gun benches, ammo benches, medic benches, melee benches)
Black market activity
- Any location related to illegal item acquisition
- Robberies may also occur following significant RP lead-up, such as debt collection or recovering stolen items.
- Robbing someone requires proper RP and a valid reason – not just convenience. You should also only take items related to the scene
- Killing someone and then robbing them is prohibited unless on Cayo during KOS times
- Killing a player and robbing them is not allowed

If you take someone hostage during gang beef you are allowed to take weapons and comms. You have to be ready for the repercussions that follow.

You are not allowed to initiate Hostile RP if the player is clocked on duty and clearly in uniform for the whitelisted business. With that being said, you can not run to your job if you are currently in Hostile RP with someone.

## Heist Rules

- Heists may include a maximum of 8 participants (3 externals max) and may only use 1 car to leave for the chase from the cops. You can include more cars once the chase has started and you have left the heist area
- Third-partying another group's heist is not allowed.

## Combat Rules

Tripping is not allowed in combat unless it is to prevent a player from fleeing or to escape pursuit. Tripping to execute someone is forbidden.

Tripping is only allowed when:
    - Attempting to prevent a player from fleeing an RP scenario
    - Attempting to escape someone pursuing you.
    - Tripping for the purpose of executing someone is strictly forbidden.

## Police Interaction Rules

- Police convoys & Prisoner Transport
    - Criminals may attempt to intercept police transport to rescure a detained individual
    - If proper declaration/initiation was made on the convoy, players may choose to siege the PD once the vehicle arrives.
**Prohibited Actions**
    - Players may not camp outside PD to initiate a scene as soon as officers arrive
    - Ramming

## Cayo Perico Island

This is a KOS zone during set times throughout the day, when the island has a red circle around it, that means it is KOS on the island and you can be killed AND robbed. Any hostile on cayo can NOT be brought to main land.
