# ❌ Fail RP and Breaking Character

Fail RP occurs when a player breaks immersion, ignores realism, or disregards the expectations of serious roleplay. Players are required to remain in-character at all times and behave in ways that reflect how a reasonable person would act in the given situation.

## Breaking Character

While in the city, speaking out of character is not allowed unless staff explicitly state the conversation is OOC. OOC terms like "server", "AFK", or "lagging" are prohibited.

## Roleplaying Injuries

- Injuries should be roleplayed realistically.
- Use /me to communicate injury severity to medical staff.
- Continue to roleplay injuries until cleared by medical staff or after hospital treatment.
- High-speed crashes require roleplay of injuries and shock.
- Do not respawn if you are in an active roleplay situation.

## Examples of Fail RP

- Unrealistic Behaviour: Performing actions that are impossible or nonsensical within the GTA V environment.
- Unrealistic Police/Emergency Interaction: Ignoring lawful orders without reason, refusing to roleplay detainment, or failing to comply with emergency services roleplay.
- Unrealistic Vehicle Use:
    - Carrying another player while driving a car.
    - Carrying another player on a motorcycle.
    - Using vehicles unrealistically (e.g., ramming cars full-speed without roleplaying damage, or constantly crashing with no consequence).
