# ❌ Fail RP and Breaking Character

Fail RP occurs when a player acts in a way that breaks immersion, ignores realism, or disregards the expectations of serious roleplay. Players are required to remain in-character at all times and behave in ways that reflect how a reasonable person would act in the given situation.

## Breaking Character

While in the city, speaking out of character (OOC) is strictly prohibited unless a staff member explicitly states that the conversation is OOC. If you are speaking with staff and they have not clearly stated that it is an OOC conversation, you must remain in character.
In addition, using OOC terms are strictly prohibited as well. Some examples of OOC terms are “server” “Going AFK” “Lagging”. Use of these terms repeatedly will result in a warning.

## Poor Roleplay

In Pinnacle, we take roleplay seriously. To encourage and contain this value, we hold the write to issue out warnings for poor roleplay. If you are given 3 warnings for poor roleplay, you will be issued a 1-3 day ban depending on the severity.

## Roleplaying Injuries

In Pinnacle, realism is paramount:

- **Injury Roleplay:** Your character's injuries in the server should be as authentic as real-life injuries. If you're shot in the chest, for instance, it's expected your character would experience laboured breathing and significant distress.
- **Communication:** When injured, it's essential to communicate the nature and severity of those injuries. Using /me to inform paramedics is a fundamental step in this process.
- **Post-Injury Roleplay:** After receiving medical attention, continue to roleplay your injuries until you're officially treated at the nearest hospital or given the green light by medical staff that your injury is healed/have minor impact on your character.  This means that you can't simulate having a severe injury, get revived, and then immediately flee or ignore medical directives.
- **Vehicle Injuries:** In the case of vehicular accidents, especially at high speeds, roleplay the aftermath appropriately. If involved in a high-speed crash, pause to roleplay the shock and possible injuries before proceeding. Crashing at high speeds and immediately continuing as if nothing happened is not permitted. The nature and duration of injury roleplay depend on the severity of the incident.
- **You must not respawn if you are in an active role-play situation.**

Always prioritise realism and empathy for your character’s situation

## Examples of Fail RP

- **Unrealistic Behaviour:** Performing actions that are impossible or nonsensical within the GTA V environment.
- **Unrealistic Police/Emergency Interaction:** Ignoring lawful orders without reason, refusing to roleplay detainment, or failing to comply with emergency services roleplay.
- **Unrealistic Vehicle Use:**
    - Carrying another player while driving a car.
    - Carrying another player on a motorcycle.
    - Using vehicles unrealistically (e.g., ramming cars full-speed without roleplaying damage, or constantly crashing with no consequence).

## Driving Rules

- **Carrying passengers:** If transporting another player in a vehicle, you may have anyone in the vehicle except the driver, carry a player.
- **Bikes:** It’s prohibited to carry someone on a bike. There’s no valid roleplay justification for this action.
- **Pitting:** You are not allowed to pit someone over 200KPH.
