# ❌ Fail RP and Breaking Character

Fail RP occurs when a player breaks immersion, ignores realism, or disregards the expectations of serious roleplay.

## Breaking Character

While in the city, speaking out of character is not allowed unless staff explicitly state the conversation is OOC. OOC terms like "server", "AFK", or "lagging" are prohibited.

## Roleplaying Injuries

- Injuries should be roleplayed realistically.
- Use /me to communicate injury severity to medical staff.
- Continue to roleplay injuries until cleared by medical staff or after hospital treatment.
- High-speed crashes require roleplay of injuries and shock.
- Do not respawn if you are in an active roleplay situation.

## Examples of Fail RP

- Unrealistic actions that do not fit the GTA V environment
- Ignoring lawful orders without reason
- Carrying another player in a car or on a motorcycle
- Using vehicles unrealistically without roleplay consequence
