# 🔁 New Life Rule

The New Life Rule activates when your character dies and is not revived by on-duty Ambulance or LSPD.

- You only remember events leading to your death if revived by Ambulance or LSPD.
- If friends move your body to the hospital, you do not regain memory.
- You cannot recount events or identify attackers while on the death screen.
- If 20 minutes pass without emergency services, you cannot recall events even if later attended.
