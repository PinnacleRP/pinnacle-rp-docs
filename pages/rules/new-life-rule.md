# 🔁 New Life Rule

The "New Life Rule" is activated once your character has faced a fatal event and hasn't been revived by either an on-duty member from the Ambulance or LSPD. Here's how it works:

- **Memory Post-Revival:** You only recall the events leading up to your demise if you're brought back by one of the aforementioned services. If friends move your body to a hospital, this doesn't restore your memory. Roleplay as if waking up in a hospital, unaware of how you got there.
- **Witness Accounts:** If someone witnessed your untimely end and informs you afterward, that information is permissible.
- **Communicating Post-Injury:** Upon reaching the death screen, you can't provide a recount of the events or identities involved. You're limited to roleplaying your injuries without disclosing names or specifics. For instance, if you're in a shootout, you can alert allies of your location, but if you're incapacitated before identifying the assailant, you can't reveal who shot you upon their arrival.
- **Extended Absence of Emergency Services:** If 20 minutes elapse post-demise without any emergency service member attending to you, you cannot recall the events leading up to your death, even if you're subsequently attended to.

This rule ensures the continuity and immersion of roleplay experiences, and we appreciate your adherence.
