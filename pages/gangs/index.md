# 🏴 Pinnacle Gang Rules

Gangs are a major part of Pinnacle Roleplay. These guidelines exist to keep conflict structured, fair, and focused on meaningful storytelling.

## Cheating Policy

If any member of a gang is found to be cheating, the gang may be disbanded, subject to Gang Staff review and discretion.

## Strike System

The strike system consists of Minor Strikes and Major Strikes.
    - Three (3) Minor Strikes will result in one (1) Major Strike.
    - All strikes and related consequences are issued at the discretion of Gang Staff.

**General Penalties**

All strikes will result in an in-city fine and a cooldown period, the length and severity of which will be determined by Gang Staff based on the offense.

**Major Strike Consequences**

- One (1) Major Strike
    - One-week hostile cooldown
    - In-city fine

- Two (2) Major Strikes
    - Ten-day hostile cooldown
    - Loss of a specified amount of weapons, materials, or drugs
    - In-city fine

- Three (3) Major Strikes
    - Gang disbandment


# 🏴 General Hostile Rules

Gang-related hostility must always be rooted in meaningful roleplay. All conflicts are expected to develop naturally through in-character actions and ongoing storylines.

    - Hostility may arise through any roleplay scenario that logically supports conflict.
    - Initiating or escalating conflict solely to enable gunplay is strictly prohibited.
    - Any gang found creating conflict without a valid roleplay foundation will not be welcomed on the server.
    - All hostile actions must be supported by a clear and ongoing RP storyline.

**Crew Baiting (Prohibited)**

Crew baiting—intentionally provoking another gang without legitimate roleplay justification—is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Spray painting another crew’s compound or turf without RP justification
    - Posting inflammatory or provocative messages on Birdy without roleplay reasoning
    - Spreading false rumors about a gang with no storyline or RP purpose

Engaging in crew baiting may result in disciplinary action.
