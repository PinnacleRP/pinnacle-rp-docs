# 🏴 Pinnacle Gang Rules

Gangs are a major part of Pinnacle Roleplay. These guidelines exist to keep conflict structured, fair, and focused on meaningful storytelling.

## Cheating Policy

If any member of a gang is found to be cheating, the gang may be disbanded, subject to Gang Staff review and discretion.

## Strike System

The strike system consists of Minor Strikes and Major Strikes.
- Three (3) Minor Strikes will result in one (1) Major Strike.
- All strikes and related consequences are issued at the discretion of Gang Staff.

**General Penalties**

All strikes will result in an in-city fine and a cooldown period, the length and severity of which will be determined by Gang Staff based on the offense.

**Major Strike Consequences**

- One (1) Major Strike
    - One-week hostile cooldown
    - In-city fine

- Two (2) Major Strikes
    - Ten-day hostile cooldown
    - Loss of a specified amount of weapons, materials, or drugs
    - In-city fine

- Three (3) Major Strikes
    - Gang disbandment


# 🏴 General Hostile Rules

Gang-related hostility must always be rooted in meaningful roleplay. All conflicts are expected to develop naturally through in-character actions and ongoing storylines.

- Hostility may arise through any roleplay scenario that logically supports conflict.
- Initiating or escalating conflict solely to enable gunplay is strictly prohibited.
- Any gang found creating conflict without a valid roleplay foundation will not be welcomed on the server.
- All hostile actions must be supported by a clear and ongoing RP storyline.

**Crew Baiting (Prohibited)**

Crew baiting—intentionally provoking another gang without legitimate roleplay justification—is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Spray painting another crew’s compound or turf without RP justification
- Posting inflammatory or provocative messages on Birdy without roleplay reasoning
- Spreading false rumors about a gang with no storyline or RP purpose

Engaging in crew baiting may result in disciplinary action.

**Multi-Gang Engagement & Handholding Policy**

Inter-gang conflicts are permitted provided the roleplay context is appropriate and the following conditions are met:

- Clear Objective Requirement
All conflicts must have a defined and legitimate in-character objective or prize. Engagements without a meaningful roleplay purpose are not permitted.

- Escalation Compliance
Standard escalation rules remain fully in effect. All involved parties must actively participate in each stage of escalation.

- KOS/Trotting/War Player Cap Regulations
In the event of KOS, trotting, or declared war:
   - If multiple gangs align against a single gang, the combined force may only exceed the opposing gang’s total player cap by a maximum of +2 players overall.
   - Example: If Gang C has a cap of 16 players, and Gangs A and B are allied against them, A and B combined may field no more than 18 players combined in total.

- Abuse & Targeting Smaller Gangs
Any abuse of this system — particularly coordinated efforts to overwhelm significantly smaller gangs without proper roleplay justification — will result in administrative action.

- Prohibited Handholding
Calling upon another gang solely to assist in combat without meaningful roleplay reasoning is considered handholding and is strictly prohibited.

All conflicts must remain fair, balanced, and grounded in logical roleplay development.
