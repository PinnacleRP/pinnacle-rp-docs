# 🧩 Gang Zone System Policy

The city is divided into five designated zones: North, South, East, West, and County. A detailed zone map is available in the Gang Discord and should be reviewed prior to submitting an application.

- Zone Selection
When applying to create a gang, applicants must select the zone in which their gang will be based. This establishes the gang’s primary area of operation.

- Purpose of Zones
The zone system is intended to:
   - Encourage meaningful roleplay.
   - Promote structured hostile roleplay.
   - Create territorial dynamics that drive organic conflict and alliances.

Gangs within a zone may:
   - Declare that a single gang controls the entire zone, or
   - Collaboratively agree that multiple gangs share control.

If a gang claims control of a zone, they may, through roleplay:
   - Impose taxes.
   - Regulate goods, services, or activity within the area.
   - Assert territorial influence consistent with logical in-character development.

- Limitations of Zone Control
Even if a gang claims control over a zone:
   - They may not forcibly remove other established gangs from the zone.
   - Individual gangs retain ownership of their respective blocks or streets.

Zone control represents influence over the broader area — not absolute authority to displace others without proper roleplay escalation.

- Incentives
Zone owners may be eligible for in-city incentives or perks. This, you would have to FOIRP.

- Trial Period
This system is currently under review as a trial policy. If it does not function as intended or leads to imbalance, it may be adjusted or removed at administration discretion.
