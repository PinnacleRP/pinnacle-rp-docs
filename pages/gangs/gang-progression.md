# 📈 Gang Progression

Progression within the Pinnacle Roleplay criminal ecosystem is earned, not given. Crews must demonstrate consistency, high-quality roleplay, and a significant impact on the server to move up the ranks.
Each progression level unlocks greater privileges, larger rosters, increased hostile capacities, and enhanced customization options. Gang progression is reviewed and approved by Gang Staff, and should reflect long-term commitment rather than activity spikes.

All progression will be monitored by staff via in city and the journal that every gang is given to fill out their roleplay interactions in pinnacle.

## Crew Application Process

1. **Prospect Crew:** To apply for a crew, you must start with a roster of 6 members. Once accepted, you will begin as a Prospect Crew. During this period (lasting **3-10 days** depending on activity and roleplay quality), your crew will not be officially recognized in the Discord or receive benefits.You also can not attend any gang events.
    - **Objective:** Make a name for yourself in the city. Host meetings, build a storyline, and create roleplay opportunities.

2. **Trial Crew:** After successfully completing the Prospect Crew period, you will be promoted to Trial Crew. Where you will then be announced in the gang discord as a Trial crew.

**Note:** Promotion is earned based on roleplay quality, activity, and participation in events. Promotions are not guaranteed.
