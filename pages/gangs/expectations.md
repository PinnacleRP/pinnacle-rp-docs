# 🎭 Roleplay Expectations and Standards

Pinnacle Roleplay is a serious roleplay environment. All gangs are expected to prioritize meaningful, story-driven roleplay over constant gunplay.

- Crews that focus solely on shooting without providing substantial roleplay will not be considered a good fit.
- High-quality, immersive gang roleplay may be rewarded in-character and out-of-character at staff discretion.

## 🏆 Gang Roleplay Recognition

A Roleplaying Gang of the Month will be selected based on contribution, creativity, and consistency. The winning gang receives an in-city reward determined by Gang Staff.

## 📖 Storyline Expectations

Gangs are expected to:

- Create and drive their own storylines
- Build long-term narratives
- Engage with the city and other groups consistently
