# 🎭 Roleplay Expectations and Standards

Pinnacle Roleplay is a serious roleplay environment. All gangs are expected to prioritize meaningful, story-driven roleplay over constant gunplay.

- Crews that focus solely on shooting without providing substantial roleplay will not be considered a good fit for the server.
- High-quality, immersive gang roleplay may be rewarded both in-character and out-of-character at the discretion of staff.

## 🏆 Gang Roleplay Recognition

A Roleplaying Gang of the Month will be selected based on contribution, creativity, and consistency. The winning gang receives an in-city reward determined by Gang Staff.

## 📖 Storyline Expectations

While the server can provide resources, assets, and opportunities, it is the responsibility of each crew to create and drive their own roleplay.

**Gangs are expected to:**

- Develop original storylines
- Explore long-term narratives
- Actively engage with the city and other groups

All crews must remain consistent with their established storylines and roleplay in accordance with them.

We expect gangs that are hostile with other gangs to actually treat it like that within roleplay. (e.g. if you are hostile with a gang, you shouldn’t have members hanging out with the other gang members.)

Pinnacle Roleplay thrives on creativity, effort, and immersion. Crews that invest in storytelling and meaningful interactions will stand out and be rewarded accordingly.
