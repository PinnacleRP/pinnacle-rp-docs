# 🚦 Conflict Boundaries and Carryover

## Hostile Beef Carryover Rules

To ensure conflicts remain fair, contained, and event-specific, hostile actions may not carry over from the following scenarios:

- Cayo Perico Island KOS
- Official Gang Events
- Crate Drop KOS
- Hold the Zone KOS
- Vendor Claiming

Any hostility, retaliation, or ongoing conflict stemming from the situations listed above must end once the event or KOS period concludes. Carrying over beef from these scenarios into general city RP is strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.

## Robbing Rival Gang Members

When robbing a rival gang member during a hostile scenario:

- You may steal any items carried on their person, except:
    - Whitelist business-related assets
- Robbing dead bodies remains strictly prohibited under all circumstances.

These rules exist to maintain immersion, fairness, and high-quality gang roleplay. All crews are expected to act in good faith and contribute to meaningful conflict rather than forced violence.


## Gang conflict & Escalation Rules

1. **Verbal Resolution — Words Come First**

    **All conflicts must begin with a genuine attempt at verbal resolution.**
- Gang leaders are required to make a good-faith effort to resolve disputes through an **in-person meeting or phone call.**
- Hostilities may **not** begin without clear **in-city reasoning and roleplay interaction.**
- Disrespect, ego clashes, and unresolved disputes are valid roleplay motivations, but they **must be expressed in character.**
- Examples of appropriate escalation:
    - “Let’s meet at the bar and talk this out.”
- Examples of inappropriate escalation:
    - “See you at your funeral.”


2. **Escalation Paths — Choose One**

Once verbal attempts fail, gangs may choose **one of the following escalation routes:**

**Route One: Melee Conflict**
 - If discussions break down and tensions rise, conflicts may escalate to melee-based confrontations.
 - Allowed weapons include fists, bats, and other melee weapons only
 - This phase is intended to allow resolution without permanent consequences.
     Examples include:
    - Gang-on-gang fights
    - Honor-based disputes
    - Organized brawls and body shots
 - Melee escalation should occur over a realistic duration and not be resolved in a single encounter. Players are encouraged to use this phase to develop roleplay.
- Some conflicts may be fully resolved through melee escalation alone.
 - In cases where melee escalation does not fully resolve the conflict, this does not grant permission to immediately escalate to firearms.
 - Even if a scene naturally escalates beyond melee, players must demonstrate believable roleplay, including fear, pressure, and a clear buildup that justifies further escalation.
- A brawl may end the conflict — or ignite a larger war.

**Route Two: Non-Lethal Hostile Actions**
If melee escalation does not make sense within the roleplay, gangs may choose to demonstrate hostility through **non-lethal actions**, provided verbal attempts were made first.

Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Kidnapping rival gang member(s)
- Tagging or vandalizing a rival gang’s compound or turf
- Robbing and threatening rival gang member(s)
- Damaging rival gang property or assets (e.g., smashing vehicle windows, slashing tires)

These actions should clearly communicate intent and escalation without **involving firearms.**


3. **Firearm Escalation — Point of No Return**

- Escalation to firearms is only permitted after:
    - Failed verbal resolution attempts, **and**
    - Completion of melee conflict **or** non-lethal hostile actions.
- Both gangs must agree before firearm escalation occurs.
- Gang leaders must conduct a meeting or phone call to formally declare a Kill-on-Sight (KOS).
- Firearm-based actions such as:
    - Shootouts
    - Drive-bys
    - Ambushes
    - Armed turf raids
        must be properly justified with strong roleplay.
- Declarations are mandatory — no silent kills, sniping, or one-sided wipeouts without roleplay buildup.
- Staff may intervene at any point if escalation is deemed invalid or unjustified.
- If all prior escalation attempts fail to resolve the conflict, firearm escalation may proceed — but only with strong, creative, and believable roleplay.
