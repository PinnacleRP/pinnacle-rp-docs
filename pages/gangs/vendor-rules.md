# 🧰 Vendor Rules

Vendor winners can choose which bench they would like within their tier. If there are multiple vendors in a tier, the highest score selects first.

Vendors can be delcared on if a gang finds the door. When the door is found, you have to catch the gang at the door purchasing the blueprints, there you hands them and tell them you are declaring on their door. Once this is stated, you are to set up a meeting with the gang leader to set up the date and time for the vendor claiming. Please open a ticket to get gang staff approval.

## Vendor holding

- Crews
    - May hold either a Tier 1 weapon vendor or an Attachment vendor — not both
- Organisations
    - May hold either Two Tier 2 vendors or one Tier 3 vendor and one Tier 2 vendor
- Syndicated
    - May hold one Tier 2 and two Tier 3 vendors at the same time
- Empire
    - May hold one Tier 1, one Tier 2 vendor and two Tier 3 vendors

All gangs that are able to hold a vendor can declare on an tier'd vendor. If you are at your cap of vendors, you must put your vendor up for claiming if you want to swap it for another one that you win from a declaration.

When vendor claiming happens server-wide, you can only compete at the time for 1 vendor that is in your tier. The multiple holdings of vendors come in place afterwards when you declare on someone else's vendor.
