# 🧰 Vendor Rules

Vendor winners can choose which bench they would like within their tier. If there are multiple vendors in a tier, the highest score selects first.

Vendors can be delcared on if a gang finds the door. When the door is found, you have to catch the gang at the door purchasing the blueprints, there you hands them and tell them you are declaring on their door. Once this is stated, you are to set up a meeting with the gang leader to set up the date and time for the vendor claiming. Please open a ticket to get gang staff approval.

## Vendor holding

- Crews
    - May hold any vendor, but can only compete in Vendor claiming for Tier 1
- Organisations
    - May hold any vendor, but can only compete in Vendor claiming for Tier 2 & 3
- Syndicated
    - May hold any vendor, but can only compete in Vendor claiming for Tier 2 & 3
- Empire
    - May hold any vendor, but can only compete in Vendor claiming for Tier 2 & 3

All gangs that are able to hold a vendor can declare on an tier'd vendor. If you are at your cap of vendors, you must put your vendor up for claiming if you want to swap it for another one that you win from a declaration.

When vendor claiming happens server-wide, you can only compete at the time for 1 vendor that is in your tier. The multiple holdings of vendors come in place afterwards when you declare on someone else's vendor.

There will only be one weapon bench per tier and one attachments bench for Tier 1 and Tier 2.
