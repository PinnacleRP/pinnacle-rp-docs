# 🧩 Crew Structure and Rules

## Non-Tagged Members

Non-tagged members can associate with a crew but are not officially rostered.

Rights and privileges:

- Participate in basic RP with the crew
- Assist in minor, non-hostile activities
- Wear crew clothing in non-hostile situations (remove clothing once it turns hostile)

Restrictions:

- Cannot participate in hostile RP
- Cannot represent the crew in official matters
- Cannot access the crew stash or equipment during conflicts

## Tagged Members

Tagged members are officially rostered and may:

- Represent the crew in hostilities
- Access gang resources
- Participate in declared wars and events
- Wear crew clothing at all times

Leaders are responsible for ensuring tagged members understand the rules.

## Tagging Cooldowns

- Returning after soft PK or crew disbandment: 7-day cooldown
- Returning after soft PK via hostile patch over loss: 3-day cooldown

## Roster Rules

- Once a war is declared, rosters are locked until the conflict ends.
- Removed members have a 10-day cooldown before rejoining the same crew.
- Roster exploitation (dropping and re-adding members to gain an advantage) is prohibited.

## Hostile Patch Over

A hostile patch over requires Gang Management approval and meaningful RP. The losing crew may respond with hostility.

Mandatory war period:

- 24-hour city-wide KOS
- Best of 3, 5, or 7 trots (decided by the losing org)

If the acquiring crew loses, the patched member is soft PK and must wait 3 days before joining another gang. If they win, the member joins immediately with no cooldown.

## Soft PK vs Hard PK

Soft PK:

- Forget the event and all gang-related memory
- No revenge based on the event

Hard PK:

- Character is permanently lost
- Must be removed from the roster
- Must be agreed in-character (Discord agreements do not count)

## Death Timer

After death in a gang-related scenario, you must wait 30 minutes before returning to the area or re-engaging the scene.
