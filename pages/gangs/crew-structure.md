# 🧩 Crew Structure and Rules

To maintain fairness, consistency, and a balanced gang system, all crews within Pinnacle Roleplay are required to follow a defined structure. This ensures that both members and leadership operate under clear guidelines and that the gang system remains immersive.

## Non-Tagged Members

Non-tagged members are individuals who associate with a crew but are not officially listed on the roster.

Rights and privileges:

- Participate in basic RP interactions with the crew.
- Assist in minor, non-hostile activities.
- Wear crew clothing in non-hostile situations (e.g., while roleplaying in civilian scenarios). Note: As soon as a situation turns hostile, clothing must be removed (trial rule).

Restrictions:

- Cannot participate in hostile RP activities (e.g., shootouts, spray contests, robberies).
- Cannot represent the crew in official matters (e.g., wars, vendor access, events).
- Cannot carry or use the crew's stash or equipment during conflicts.

Any attempt to "stack" non-tagged members during conflicts will result in disciplinary action.

Any non tagged member WEARING gang clothing breaking any rules, may result in a gang strike/punishment

## Tagged Members

Tagged members are officially listed on the crew roster and hold full gang privileges:

- Represent the crew in hostile and defensive engagements.
- Access gang resources (e.g., stash, turf, sprays).
- Participate in declared wars and crew-specific events.
- Wear crew clothing at all times.

It is the leader's responsibility to ensure that all tagged members are aware of the rules and consequences related to representing the crew.

## Tagging Cooldowns

To prevent roster abuse, the following cooldowns apply:
    - Returning after Soft PK via Hostile Patch Over Loss: 3-day cooldown.
    - Returning after Soft PK or Crew Disbandment: 7-day cooldown.

Note: Cooldowns are server-wide and may only be waived with Gang Staff approval.

## Roster Rules

- Once a war is declared, rosters are locked until the conflict ends.
- Removed members have a 10-day cooldown before rejoining the same crew.
- Roster exploitation (dropping and re-adding members to gain an advantage) is prohibited.

## Hostile Patch Over

A Hostile Patch Over occurs when a crew acquires a member from another crew. This can be permitted, but must be supported by strong roleplay and meaningful conflict.

Requirements:
    - Approval must be obtained from gang management before initiating a hostile patch over.
    - The crew losing the member in the patch over may respond with hostility toward the acquiring crew, resulting in ongoing in-character conflict.

Mandatory Patch-Over war period:

The following both have to happen in order:
- 24-Hour KOS: City-wide Kill On Sight (KOS) for 24 hours.
- Best of 3, 5, or 7 Rounds of Trotting: Decided by the organization losing the member

- If the crew acquiring the member loses: Immediate Soft PK of the patched member. The member must wait 3 days before joining another gang.
- If the crew acquiring the member wins: The patched member joins immediately with no cooldown or pk

Once the war period ends, the conflict is considered resolved, regardless of the outcome.

## Soft PK vs Hard PK

**Soft PK (Partial Death):**

- You forget the events of the scenario and lose all memory related to the interaction.
- You forget everything related to the gang (members, stash, turf, etc.).
- You may remember that you were once part of the gang but nothing more.
- You cannot seek revenge or retaliate based on the event.

**Hard PK (Full Death):**

- Your character is permanently lost, and you have no further ties to the gang or storyline.
- You must be removed from the crew roster.
- Your character must be fully deleted and wiped from the server.

All Hard PKs must be agreed upon in roleplay. Discord agreements will not be recognized. A clipping recording of the agreement must be provided upon request from Gang Staff.

## Death Timer

Upon death in a gang-related scenario, you are required to wait 30 minutes before returning to the area or re-engaging in the same scene.

## Roster Rules

To maintain fairness and prevent roster manipulation, the following rules apply to all crews during active conflicts:

    - Roster Lock: Once a war has been officially declared, crew rosters are locked and may not be modified until the conflict has concluded.
    - Member Removal Cooldown: Any member removed from a crew is subject to a 10-day cooldown before they are eligible to rejoin the same crew.
    - Roster Exploitation: Any attempt to exploit the roster system—such as repeatedly dropping and re-adding the same members to gain an advantage—is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action.

Roster rules are also specified in rules depending on the scenario that you are in. Please read all of the rules for clarification.
