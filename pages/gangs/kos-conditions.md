# ⚔️ KOS and War Declarations

To ensure fair play, structured conflict, and clear expectations, all Kill-On-Sight (KOS) periods and war declarations must follow the guidelines outlined below. All KOS and Wars must have an out/settlement for both parties.

## KOS Timeframes

Approved KOS durations:

- 24-hour KOS
- 48-hour KOS

During an active KOS period, one of the following must apply:

- Full City-Wide KOS for the entire duration, or
- Agreed-upon trots at specific times for agreed lengths (Gang Staff must be notified prior).

Flying out to avoid KOS OR hiding out of colors will be an automatic forfeit of the war and what was at stake is immediately to be paid. The crew that flew out will also be subject to a fine in the city and possible strike.

## Initiating KOS

KOS may be initiated by either party once both sides have engaged in hostile actions toward one another.

Hostile actions include, but are not limited to:

- Kidnapping
- Physical assault (punching)
- Spray painting or contesting turf

A KOS period must be completed before a formal war declaration can take place.

## Declaring War

- A KOS period must be completed before a formal war declaration can take place.

- One party must clearly state their intent to declare war on the other.

### Required Discussion During Declaration

Both parties must mutually agree on the rules of engagement, which may include:

- Additional KOS periods
- What is at stake (outs, settlements, consequences)
- Claiming script
- Roof access rules
- Setups and ambush rules
- Allowed weapon tiers
- Player caps
- Any other agreed-upon conditions

All agreed rules are binding for the duration of the war.

## Post-War Cooldown

Once a war has concluded, neither party may engage in conflict over the same objective until a 1-week cooldown has passed.

## Posting Requirements

All war declarations must be posted in the designated War Declaration channel.

- If staff assistance is required:
    - Gang Staff must approve the declaration before it begins.
- If staff assistance is not required:
    - Both crew leaders must react to and agree on the declaration post.
- Declarations must follow the official format provided in the Declaration Channel. Incomplete or improperly formatted declarations may be deemed invalid.

These rules exist to ensure structured, fair, and meaningful conflict while preserving the quality of roleplay across the server. Failure to follow these procedures may result in disciplinary action.

## Kill on Site (KOS) Areas

Gang tablet supply drops:
- The area where the drop is happening is KOS. You are **NOT** allowed to loot bodies.
- Hostile cooldowns still apply.
- You must be apart of a crew or higher (meaning you have access to the gang tablet) to participate.
- Fued from this does not carry over to main storyline RP with the other gangs. Treat this as if it was Cayo.

Capture the zone mission:
- The area where the zone is, is KOS. You are **NOT** allowed to loot bodies.
- Hostile cooldowns still apply.
- You must be apart of a crew or higher (meaning you have access to the gang tablet) to participate.
- Fued from this does not carry over to main storyline RP with the other gangs. Treat this as if it was Cayo.

Cayo Perico Island:
- KOS
- Looting bodies for everything is allowed
- Fued from Cayo does not carry over to mainland.
