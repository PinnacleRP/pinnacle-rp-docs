# ⚔️ KOS and War Declarations

All Kill-On-Sight (KOS) periods and war declarations must follow these guidelines. Every KOS or war must have an out or settlement for both parties.

## KOS Timeframes

Approved KOS durations:

- 24-hour KOS
- 48-hour KOS

During an active KOS period, one of the following must apply:

- Full city-wide KOS for the entire duration, or
- Agreed-upon trots at specific times for agreed lengths (Gang Staff must be notified prior).

## Initiating KOS

KOS may be initiated by either party once both sides have engaged in hostile actions. Hostile actions include:

- Kidnapping
- Physical assault
- Spray painting or contesting turf

A KOS period must be completed before a formal war declaration can take place.

## Declaring War

War declarations must occur during a formal in-character meeting between crew leadership. One party must clearly state their intent to declare war.

### Required Discussion During Declaration

Both parties must agree on rules of engagement, including:

- Additional KOS periods
- What is at stake (outs, settlements, consequences)
- Claiming script
- Roof access rules
- Setups and ambush rules
- Allowed weapon tiers
- Player caps

## Post-War Cooldown

After a war concludes, neither party may engage in conflict over the same objective until a 1-week cooldown has passed.

## Posting Requirements

All war declarations must be posted in the designated War Declaration channel.

- If staff assistance is required, Gang Staff must approve before it begins.
- If staff assistance is not required, both leaders must react and agree on the post.
- Declarations must follow the official format in the channel.
